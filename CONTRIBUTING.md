# Contributing

Keep the package small and independently useful. Preserve the user's requested
outcome, the two hybrid profiles, explicit profile selection, and owned-file safety.
Do not add company-specific paths, private examples, account data, or mandatory
third-party workflow dependencies to the public payload.

## Local checks

Run `npm test`. Tests must use disposable Codex and discovery homes, never the real
user directories. Installer tests establish file operations, not model behavior.
Review the [behavior cases](evaluation/cases.json) when changing instructions. They
are acceptance scenarios, not a claim of measured model performance. A live smoke
requires an explicit request because it starts real agents and consumes quota.

For installer changes, test the actual CLI and installed consumer paths, including
update/removal and preservation of unrelated files. For instruction changes, check
the whole assignment/worker/reviewer relationship rather than adding keyword-only
tests for each sentence. Self-review one complete block before independent review.

## Model and policy releases

Keep product, role, and skill names stable. Update `payload/profiles.json`, native
profile configs, dispatch guidance, README tables, and any affected behavior cases
together. Verify actual availability and routing before claiming a model works.
Do not hardcode models in role TOMLs or promise universal cost savings.

Use semantic versions and a changelog. Patch releases fix defects without changing
profile responsibilities; minor releases may add compatible routing capabilities or
update default model policy, with explicit release notes; major releases cover
breaking CLI, ownership/state, or workflow contracts. Treat a model change as a
user-visible policy change even when it does not require a major version.

Before a release: run tests, inspect `npm pack --dry-run`, review the distributable
for private paths/data, create an immutable version tag, and publish release notes.
The repository is directly executable through npm's GitHub package spec; registry
publication is a separate optional distribution channel, not a runtime requirement.

## Bug reports

Include Node/npm and Codex versions, OS, package version, command, expected and actual
behavior, and a minimal anonymized reproduction. Do not attach auth files, full Codex
configurations, session histories, tokens, or unrelated global instructions.
